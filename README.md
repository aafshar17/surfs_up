# Project Description

The purpose of this Surfs Up project is to share collected climate analysis data with the community. To do so, we are using 3 different Jupyter notebooks for data engineering, database engineering, and climate analysis. The goal is to provide meaningful information while learning how to effectively use in tandem Python libraries such as SQL Alchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

# Observations

1. Station USC00518838 was the least busy station with only 511 weather observations. This represents not even a 1/4 of the number of observations conducted at the busiest station.

2. As expected, the total number of observations at the busiest station increased with higher temperatures up until around 77 degrees Fahrenheit. 

3. The average temperature from the trip from 03/12-03/19 last year was 67.21 degrees Fahrenheit.
