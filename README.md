# Surfs Up

## Project Description

The purpose of this Surfs Up project is to share collected climate analysis data with the community. To do so, use 3 different Jupyter notebooks for data engineering, database engineering, and climate analysis. Use SQLAlchemy to model the table schemas and create a sqlite database for the tables. Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration on your new weather station tables. The goal is to provide meaningful information while learning how to effectively use in tandem Python libraries such as SQL Alchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
