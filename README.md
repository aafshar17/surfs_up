# Surfs Up

## Project Description

Used 3 different Jupyter notebooks for data engineering, database engineering, and climate analysis to share collected climate analysis data with the community. Used SQLAlchemy to model the table schemas and create a sqlite database for the tables. Wrote Python script using Pandas and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration on weather station tables. The goal is to provide meaningful information while learning how to effectively use in tandem Python libraries such as SQL Alchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
